= Colophon

A colophon is entirely optional and its use has, sadly, fallen out of fashion.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)[Wikipedia - Colophon (publishing)]

Personally, I use the colophon to pimp the open-source tools I used in the creation of the work.
Invariably, I also link to those tools.
Asciidoctor, Asciidoctor-epub3, Scribus, GIMP, Inkscape, etc.
I usually also include a __how__ I used them.
Be brief, though.
Most people find this pretty boring.
It's why I put it at the back instead of the front.
