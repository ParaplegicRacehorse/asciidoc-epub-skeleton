= Epigraph

From http://www.literarydevices.com/epigraph/[Literary Devices]:

In literature, an epigraph is a short quotation that is set at the beginning of a text or section of a text to suggest the theme of what’s to come. 
The epigraph can be a quote from a famous person, an excerpt or full text of a poem, phrase, lyric, or definition. 
Epigraphs can be a sort of preface or can set the mood or tone of the following work. 
Epigraphs can also invite the reader to make a comparison between what the epigraph says and what the rest of the text is about. 
Some authors use epigraphs to tie their own literature to the greater body of literature in the world.

The word epigraph comes from the Greek word epigraphein, which means “to write on.” 
The contemporary definition of epigraph was introduced into English in the mid-19th century, when it came to mean a motto or pithy sentence that prefaces a book or chapter of a book.
