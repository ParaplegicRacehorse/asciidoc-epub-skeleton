= Preface

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preface[Wikipedia]:

A preface (/ˈprɛfᵻs/) or proem (/ˈproʊɛm/) is an introduction to a book or other literary work written by the work's author. 
An introductory essay written by a different person is a foreword and precedes an author's preface. 
The preface often closes with acknowledgments of those who assisted in the literary work.

A preface generally covers the story of how the book came into being, or how the idea for the book was developed; this is often followed by thanks and acknowledgments to people who were helpful to the author during the time of writing.

A preface is usually signed (and the date and place of writing often follow the typeset signature); a foreword by another person is always signed. 
Information essential to the main text is generally placed in a set of explanatory notes, or perhaps in an "Introduction" that may be paginated with Arabic numerals, rather than in the preface. 
The term preface can also mean any preliminary or introductory statement. 
It is sometimes abbreviated pref.
